#### Introduction to Genomic Epidemiology

Unravel the evolutionary relationships among organisms with an introduction to phylogenetics. This fascinating field combines biology, mathematics, and computer science to reconstruct the branching history of life. Learn how scientists use genetic data and fossil evidence to build evolutionary trees, understand species diversification, and trace the origins of traits. Explore key concepts such as common ancestry, molecular clocks, and comparative methods that form the backbone of modern evolutionary biology and inform fields from medicine to conservation.
