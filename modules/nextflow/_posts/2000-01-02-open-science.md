## Open science

"Open science is the framework with a focus on making science more accessible, inclusive and equitable for the benefit of all" – UNESCO

1. Open data (ensuring data is freely available and adheres to FAIR data
   principles).
2. Open access publishing (making peer-review scholarly research articles and
   literature freely available).
3. Open source (software code is easily accessible for inspection, modification
   and improvement/enhancement).
4. Open peer review, open notebooks and open standards enable reproducible science.
