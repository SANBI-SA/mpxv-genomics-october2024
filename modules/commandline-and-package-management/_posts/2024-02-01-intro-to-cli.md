title: Introduction to Linux and the Bash shell

### Introduction to Linux

These lessons will focus on drawing together and supplementing existing resources on using Bash and common command line utilities.
The Bash shell is typically used as part of the Linux or MacOS operating systems and while both of these operating systems share
a common origin in the Unix of the 1970s, 80s and 90s, there are also some differences between Linux and MacOS that we will
note as we go along.
