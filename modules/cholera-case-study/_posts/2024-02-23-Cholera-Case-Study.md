### Vibrio cholerae

_Vibrio cholerae_, for the most part, is a natural inhabitant of aquatic ecosystems, where it is found in association
with many different organisms that live in or interact with the aquatic environment, such as birds, fish, copepods
and crustaceans. Members of this species can be serotyped based on the O-antigens associated with polysaccharides found
on the outer membrane of the cell. Of the more than 200 known serogroups of _Vibrio cholerae_ only two, O1 and O139,
are associated with the gastroentistinal disease cholera.

The pathogenic strains of _V. cholerae_ have, integrated in their genomes, genes of the CTXϕ phage that include the ctxA
and ctxB genes that together assemble the cholera toxin. Pathogenic _V. cholerae_ strains also contain the tcpA gene
(part of the _Vibrio_ pathogenicity island 1 - VPI-1) and others genes that assemble the toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP),
a structure essential for the formation of _V. cholerae_ microcolonies and colonisation of the human gut.

The current outbreaks of cholera that occur around the world are caused by a strain of _V. cholerae_ that evolved
in the 1950s and sparked the 7th cholera pandemic, which started in Indonesia. The evolutionary history of this
strain leads back to the _El Tor_ strain of cholera that emerged in Egypt in the early 20th century, but several
evolutionary stages took place before the final pandemic strain arose.

[Hu et al](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1608732113) describe in detail the stages of evolution
of the 7th pandemic strain, which happened through a series of recombination events, infection with the CTXϕ
phage and acquisition of two new pathogenicity islands (VSP-I and VSP-II). The 7th pandemic itself has
progressed in several overlapping waves, which have also involved genetic changes such as the acquisition of
the SXT integrating conjugative element. We are currently in the 3rd wave of the 7th cholera pandemic.

The following figure (from [Montero et al](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2023.1155751/full))
graphically illustrates the evolution and classification of _V. cholerae_:

Since its emergence in the 1960s, 7th pandemic cholera has been imported into Africa 13 different
times, with each introduced by identified as T1 up until T13 (see [Weill et al](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad5901) and 
[Bwire et al](https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0006492)). The particular strains of
_V. cholerae_ that made up the T12 import into Africa are also associated with the reemergence of cholera
in Haiti from 2010 onwards.

As is illustrated by the above short history, _V. cholerae_ is highly diverse species of baceteria whose genomic evolution
involves both recombination and horizontal gene transfer (sometimes mediated by phages) and clonal expansion of evolutionarily
successful strains. This pattern of diversity and clonality is common to several bacteria, where a species can involve
remarkable diversity and an outbreak (even a large one) clonal expansion of a successful clone.

For the purposes of our practical study we will be working with some sequences associated with cholera in Haiti. These
are drawn from BioProject [PRJNA510624](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA510624), whose analysis was published in
two papers by [Mavian et al](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1918763117?doi=10.1073%2Fpnas.1918763117) and
