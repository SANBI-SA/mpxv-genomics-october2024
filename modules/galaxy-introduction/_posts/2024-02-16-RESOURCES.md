#### Galaxy Chat and Matrix

The Galaxy Chat rooms use a chat system called Matrix. For this you need a Matrix client, such as Element.
Some instructions on getting started with Matrix are [here](https://www.ubuntubuzz.com/2022/11/getting-started-to-matrix-chat-for-beginners.html).

If you don't want to install a new chat client on your computer you can use the web version of Element
at [app.element.io](https://app.element.io). Once you have your Matrix client set up, you can navigate to the [chat link](https://matrix.to/#/#galaxyproject:matrix.org)
as shown above to get a list of Galaxy Project chat rooms. One of the most useful for people learning Galaxy is
the [Galaxy Training Network chat room](https://app.element.io/#/room/#Galaxy-Training-Network_Lobby:gitter.im).
